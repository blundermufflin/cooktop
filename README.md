# Cooktop

A multi-interface platform to make daily tasks for software developers easier

Feature Idea
## web/native client

- cheat sheets

## Backend API + database
- GraphQl
- PostgreSQL
- data stays private (can be self-hosted)
- Low performance impact

## Browser extension (Chrome, maybe Firefox?)
- Bookmark manager
- opening saved sets of tabs for a given workflow
- Better search history: group by site google, stackoverflow, npm | most common | sortable/filterable

## CLI
- CLI - open cheatsheet

## Plugin Architecture
- Integrations: Slack, Github, JIRA, Gmail, GCal, HackerNews, Medium, ToDo-ist, Evernote, Reddit, Discord, etc.
